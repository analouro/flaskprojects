# flaskprojects

Day 1:
Your goal by the end of this week is to create a Todo List web app using Flask. This will give you a lot of the technical and practical knowledge you need to create your final projects in week 5, so it's imperative you all complete this mini project! It will also give you chance to run in to any issues you might face and learn how to solve them.

Each day, I'm going to post a collection of user stories that show you what functionality I want to see you implement in your apps by the end of the day. Day 1's user stories are as follows:

As a user, I want to add a new todo task, so I know I have a task to be completed
As a user, I want to view my todo tasks, so that I know what I need to do
As a user, I want to change the description of the task, so I can update its contents after creating it
As a user, I want to delete a task, in case I don't need to do that task anymore
As a user, I want to set a todo task as completed, so I know which tasks I've already done
As a user, I want to set a todo task as incomplete, in case a complete task still needs doing
For this, you will need to create a basic Flask application with Routes to complete all the CRUD functionality and a Database Model that will store all the ToDo tasks in a sqlite database.

Day 2: 
• As a user, I want to view all my todo tasks on the home page of the application, so that I can know what tasks still need completing as soon as I navigate to the website
• As a user, I want to see which tasks I've completed, so I can see how much I've achieved vs how much I still need to do
• As a user, I want a separate webpage for adding tasks, so that I can navigate to that page whenever I want to add a new task
• As a user, want a separate webpage for updating tasks, so that I can navigate to that page whenever I want to add a new task
• As a user, want a separate webpage for deleting tasks, so that I can navigate to that page whenever I want to add a new task

Day 3:
As a user, I want to add a new todo task with a description using a web form, so I can keep track of things I need to do via a user interface
•    As a user, I want to change the description of the task using a web form, so I can update its contents after creating it via a user interface
•    As a user, I want to delete a task with a click of a button, so that I can quickly and easily delete a task
•    As a user, I want to set a todo task as completed with a click of a button, so I know which tasks I've already done
•    As a user, I want to set a todo task as incomplete with a click of a button, in case a complete task still needs doing
